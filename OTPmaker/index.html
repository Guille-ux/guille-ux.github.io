    <h2> What is an OTP?</h2>
    <div class="mybtn">
	<p>An OTP is a One Time Pad, that in cryptography is...</p>
	<li> Is symetric (the same password for encrypt and decrypt)
	<li> The password is never recycled
	<li> The password has the same length as the text to encrypt as
	<li> Is complely random </li>
	<p> This makes the OTP the perfect secret because... for example imagine caesar cipher but with a diferent password for every letter of the text, is impossible to find out the original text, Why? thats because having a password of the same length as the text as we have all combinations of letters for that length.<p>
